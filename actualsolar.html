            <h3 class="definition">Solar energy harnesses the natural energy of the sun, which has the power to both heat objects up and provides light to the Earth.</h3>
            <p class="specific-description">
                There are types of solar energy rigs for both of these sun's powers. 
                When dealing with the heat transferred from the sun, solar-thermal units are used, while when dealing with the light transferred from the sun, photovoltaic units are used. 

                <br>
                <br>
                <br> 
                Photovoltaic Modules - the significantly more popular option - 
                are primarily made up of silicon, a glass sheet for mechanical support/protection, encapsulation layers for ultraviolet and moisture protection, 60-96 individual 15-centimeter-square solar cells (each capable of making 4-5 watts for peak illumination), a backsheet for protection, and an aluminum frame for mounting.
                For the common dimensions of 1 meter x 1.5 meter, peak power ranges from 260 W to 320 W. 
                When the PV module is illuminated by sunlight, photons are transmitted into each solar cell. The photons with sufficient energy get absorbed. This absorbed photon then transfers its energy to an election from a silicon atom. Then, an internal electric field built into the solar cell pulls electrons toward one electrode  (does the same thing with the electrons' positively changed counterpart - the hole). This movement of electrons generates a DC current.
                A PV array consists of multiple interconnected PV modules. Then, in a grid-connected system, a set of transformers, combiners, and inverters convert the low voltage DC out the many PV modules into one collective high-voltage AC current. This is fed onto the grid (MIT).

            <h2 class="main-header">Benefits:</h2>
            <p class="pro-description">In theory, PV array's have the same efficiency per unit area no matter the size of that specific array. Therefore, at a reduced scale, photovoltaic solar technology remains just as efficient, while other sources of renewable energy (thermal and wind), begin to lose efficiency as their size is reduced.
            <br> Furthermore, Solar energy is immensely abundant. The US Department of Energy stated that an hour and a half of sunlight which reaches the planet's surface would be able to generate enough power for all of humanity's energy requirements for one entire year.  Therefore, using even an incredibly small amount of sunlight as energy can produce a large amount of energy (Igini).<br>
            Solar power is becoming incredibly inexpensive: the International Energy Agency confirmed that solar power now produces the cheapest electriciy in history.
            <br> Solar panels are becoming more and more efficient yearly. However, the majority of arrays are still only able to transfer 15-20% of the energy which they come in contact with into proper AC current (Igini).

            <h2 class="main-header">Solar Thermal Technology:</h2>
            <p class="pro-description">Solar thermal power systems capture heat from the sun to create electricity. All thermal systems have solar energy collectors with two main parts: reflectors, that capture sunlight onto a reciever. The majority of systems use a heat-transfer fluid which is heated and circulated in the reciever. 
                This fluid is used to produce steam, since the hot fluid transfers its heat to water to make steam. Once the steam is made, it is converted into mechanical energy in a turbine, in turn powering a generator to produce electricity (Department of Energy).
            <br>
            There are three main types of transfer fluids (Each has its own benefits and limitations)
            <br> 
            Water: Its inexpensive, noncorrosive, with a high specific heat capacity, but has a low boiling point which can hinder heat transfer.
            <br> 
            Propylene Glycol: Nontoxic, higher boiling point, with a lower freezing point. While it may seem perfect, a propylene glycol system is hard to maintain, as it has to be pressurized and replaced every 3-5 years.
            <br>
            Silicone: Low freezing point and a high boiling point, but it has a high viscosity, meaning it will take a lot of energy to pump, it has a low specific heat capacity, and can leak very easily, potentially jeopardizing the entire system.
            </p>

            <h2 class="main-header">Limitations:</h2>
            <p class="con-description">A lack of daylight and certain weather conditions impede solar energy production considerably (Igini). Therefore, solar power production varies greatly with the weather, and therefore is not very reliable.
                Directly generates only DC current, so an inverter is required to transfer that into AC current (which is what the grid uses).
                Solar energy is still expensive compared to its conventional counterparts, with at-home installations typically costing around $20,000 USD (Igini).

            <h2 class="main-header">Relevant Chemical Processes:</h2>
            <p class="chem-eq">
                PV Technology:
                <br>
                Photovolatic technology does not use any form of chemical reaction to produce electricity. Instead, it uses the photoelectric affect to destabilize electrons from their atoms. Essentially, the photoelectric affect dictates that electrons can be ejected from their respective atom when they have enough energy to leave (Zumdahl Zumdahl). This occurs in PV modules when photons strike silicon, thereby creating free-roaming electrons. Thus creating current through the following half reaction:
                <br>
                Si → e<sup>-</sup> + Si<sup>+</sup>
                <br>
                Solar Thermal Technology:
                <br> 
                The main process used to generate electricity for thermal technology is that of turning water into steam. This takes the reaction H<sub>2</sub><i>(l)</i> + ΔH→H<sub>2</sub>O<i>(g)</i>. This net enthalpy change in the reactants side comes from the heat generated by sunlight, and therefore is 100% clean.

            <h2 class="main-header">Usage:</h2>
            <p class="usage">Solar Energy is essentially a viable source of energy on any landmass on the planet which gets a decent source of daylight. Therefore, it is becoming one of the most common forms of renewable energy, and is expected to become the most popular form of energy production by 2050 (Igini) As of now however, solar power makes up roughly</p>
