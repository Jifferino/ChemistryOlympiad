            <h3 class="definition">Biofuel is a renewable energy source that is produced from plant and animal matter called <i>biomass</i></h3>
            <p class="specific-description">Biofuels can exist in solid, liquid, or gas phases. This makes them extremely practical for substituting for fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas.<br>
            The most common types of biofuel are as listed:
            <ui>
                <li>
                    Ethanol
                    <p>Ethanol is a type of alcohol and is used mostly in the liquid state. It is produced from plant material such as corn and sugarcane and is created from the fermentation process of bacteria and yeast which turn plant sugars into the ethanol.
                        <br>Ethanol is particularly useful because it can be mixed with gasoline to act as a fuel for motor vehicles. If you've ever seen a sign at a gas station read E10 or E15 or something similar this is refering to the concentration of ethanol (E10 is 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline). You've also probably noticed that the larger the E number the cheaper the fuel, this is because ethanol is cheaper than gasoline and so more ethanol is cheaper fuel. 
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li>Biodiesel
                    <p>Biodiesel is another liquid biofuel and is similar to ethanol in its uses. It is also made from vegetable oil (from soybeans) and animal fat. Biodiesel can also be mixed with diesel and it is labeled as B Number like B50 or B75. The nice thing about biodiesel is that it can be used a complete replacement to diesel and B100 can be used by most cars. This is unlike ethanol which can't reach high concentrations for most cars.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Wood
                    <p>Wood is a solid biofuel and has already been used by humans for thousands of years to create energy. Wood produces heat when it is burned which can be used by power generators to produce electricity. Note that wood is not limited to trees but some other plants as well.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Biogas
                    <p>Biogas is a gaseous biofuel that is mostly made up of methane and carbon dioxide. It is produced by bacteria as a byproduct which can use leftover waste to create the biogas, which is why it is often created near landfills. Comapred to alternative gaseous fules like methane, biogas has a sharp reduction in greenhouse gas emmisions.</p>

            </ui>

            <h2 class="main-header">Benefits:</h2>
            <p class="pro-description">Biofuels largest positive is the fact that it can be used in so many ways as a variety of fuel sources whether it be for cars, to make electricity, or to heat up homes. 
                <br>In addition, the fact that biofuel is an effective substitute for diesel increases its demand, especially since it can lower already rising prices.
                <br>An obvious benefit is some biofuel's ability to reuse waste by converting into energy, increasing our ability to recycle. 
                <br>Biofuel is one of the best alternative sources because it can be produced on a large scale in farms and can meet large percentages of the energy needs of the country.
            </p>

            <h2 class="main-header">Limitations:</h2>
            <p class="con-description">Perhaps the most controversial aspect of biofuels is the amount of resources needed to produce it. While biofuel is not mined but rather grown or cultivated, opponents have argued that the production of biofuel takes away from the food supply and that increasing demand for biofuel can cause a significant amount of food to be wasted on fuel rather than consumption. This argument also holds relevance with the vast amounts of land that needs to be cleared to grow the necessary crops.
                <br>However, currently the biggest problem with biofuels is that their advantage is that they are simply renewable but they still contribute to adding greenhouse gases through the farming equipment needed to create them.
            </p>

            <h2 class="main-header">Relevant Chemical Processes:</h2>
            <p class="chem-eq">
                The fermentation process needed to create ethanol is shown:
                <br>
                C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>6</sub>→2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH + 2CO<sub>2</sub>
                Here, sucrose sugar is being broken down into ethanol and also carbon dioxide.
                <br>
                <b>For the reaction to occur, the temperature must reach somewhere between 40-50° C.
                <br>
                The molecular structure of CO<sub>2</sub> is linear. 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH consists of 2 tetrahedral stuctures around the carbon atoms, and a bent structure between the COH bond.
                 The molecular structure of the sucrose consists of: 6 tetrahedral structures all around the carbon atoms in the carbon chain, along with 5 bent molecular structures in the COH bond.</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                The burning of wood is as follows:
                <br>         △
                <br>C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>O<sub>z</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> + Heat
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>The reaction typically occurs when there is enough O<sub>2</sub> in the air to react with the wood, and when a high amount of energy is put into the system.
                <br>
                The molecular structures of H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub> are bent and linear respectively </b>
                <br>
                Since wood is made up of many types of carbohydrates, we denote the subscripts with variable amounts. Here wood is reacting with oxygen as well as an initial burst of heat (spark) to create water vapor, carbon dioxide, and heat.

            <h2 class="main-header">Usage:</h2>
            <p class="usage">Biofuel has a variety of usage as covered. From being mixed with gasoline and diesel for vehicle transportation to create electricity from the heat generated by burning the fuel, biofuels are ready to overtake demand for fossil fuels and replace them.</p>
