            <h3 class="definition">Geothermal power works by harnessing the heat from the magma under the Earth's crust.</h3>
            <p class="specific-description">This heat can come in many forms, commonly volcanoes and geysers. In Iceland, a majority of the power comes from geothermal energy because of the prevalence of volcanoes. 
                This heat is then used to turn water into steam, which goes through a turbine and generator to then produce electricity from the steam. 
                This energy source is renewable because the heat used to power the plant comes from magma that will exist for billions of years to come, and it does not produce any fossil fuels.
                Geothermal energy can be located in many regions of the world where geothermal deposits are available. These regions primarily happen to be on quarternary tectonic plate lines (Faulds and Hinz), because these plate lines bring the geothermal deposits closer to the Earth's surface. Due to a large amount of these fault lines running through the Pacific Northwest, geothermal energy is prevalent there.   </p>

            <h2 class="main-header">Benefits:</h2>
            <p class="pro-description">Geothermal energy is a more renewable, accessible, and clean energy source than other sources. 
                Renewability wise, geothermal energy is 100% renewable (Department of Energy). This is because the magma from the Earth’s core will exist for billions of years to come, and it is always being replenished by radioactive decays of Uranium-238, Thorium-232, and Potassium-40 (Berkeley Lab).
                Geothermal energy is always accessible once a plant is made. In all forms of weather conditions, geothermal plants can operate. (Department of Energy)
                Geothermal energy is one of the cleanest energies to use and create. Geothermal energy has no fossil fuel emission as a result of creation, and establishing a geothermal plant has a much lower emission life cycle than its alternatives. Furthermore, geothermal energy uses less average water than all of its conventional counterparts.
                </p>

            <h2 class="main-header">Limitations:</h2>
            <p class="con-description">The two main limitations/disadvantages of geothermal energy are that of availability and that of cost. Geothermal energy is not available everywhere. 
                The nature of geothermal energy requires that geothermal sites are nearby to power the plant. This oftentimes is not the case, since this requires geothermal deposits such as geysers and volcanoes to be near the ground and the plant.
                 Next, geothermal energy is expensive. Geothermal energy costs twice that of conventional coal powered energy, coming out to 4-8 cents per kWh of geothermal energy compared to 2-3 cents per kWh of conventional, coal powered electricity (University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire). Another minor disadvantage of geothermal energy is their link to earthquakes.
                 Due to enhanced geothermal processes, or processes where water is injected into rocks to split them and reveal the geothermal deposit underneath, minor earthquakes can occur as a result (Stanford).
            </p>

            <h2 class="main-header">Relevant Chemical Reactions:</h2>
            <p class="chem-eq">The main reaction that occurs in geothermal plants is that of turning water into steam. This takes the reaction H<sub>2</sub>O<i>(l)</i> + ΔH→H<sub>2</sub>O<i>(g)</i>. This net enthalpy change in the reactants side comes from the magma, and does not emit any fossil fuels as a result of the reaction. 
                This reaction can happen at any pressure, but it has to occur at 100ºC, the boiling point of water, in order for the water to turn into steam and then spin the turbine/generator. This temperature limit is reached through the heat from the geothermal deposit. <br>

                The other relevant chemical reactions for geothermal energy are radioactive decay reactions that happen in the Earth's core to make sure that magma is alway readily availiable. These reactions occur seemingly randomly, moving from their unstable states to the stable state, often emitting an alpha particle (in the case of the decay of U-238), a beta particle (in the case of the decay of Th-234), or an antineutrino (in the case of the decay of K-40). 
                Since these reactions happen in the Earth's core, the atoms need to be under immense pressures and temperatures in order to occur. 
                <br>These reactions are: <sup>238</sup><sub>92</sub>U → <sup>234</sup><sub>90</sub>Th + <sup>4</sup><sub>2</sub>He + ΔH. <br>

                <sup>234</sup><sub>90</sub>Th → <sup>234</sup><sub>91</sub>Pa + <sup>0</sup><sub>-1</sub>e + ΔH. <br>

                <sup>40</sup><sub>19</sub>K → <sup>40</sup><sub>20</sub>Ca + e<sup>-</sup> + ν̄

            <h2 class="main-header">Usage:</h2>
            <p class="usage">Geothermal energy can only be used in regions which have geothermal deposits of magma or hydrothermal sources. These deposits include geysers, volcanoes, and hot springs. 
                Geothermal energy is used primarily in countries/regions with a high prevalence of these geothermal deposits, such as Iceland. Due to Iceland's large prevalence of volcanoes and hot springs, geothermal energy makes up 66% of their energy grid (National Energy Authority-Iceland). 
                Domestically, geothermal energy is primarily harnessed on the West Coast, in states such as California, Hawaii, and Nevada. This is due to the "Ring of Fire", or a major tectonic plate boundary, which brings geothermal resources nearer to the surface. (Energy Information Administration).
